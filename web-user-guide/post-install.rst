Post-Installation Set-Up
========================

The first time you connect to Opal (as an administrator), you will automatically be redirected to the databases administration page: Opal is made of two distinct databases: one for the holding the participants identifiers and another one for holding the variable catalog and participant data. Opal requires to have one identifiers database and at least one data database registered to be fully functional. Defining a different database user for each of these databases ensures the participant data privacy. See Identifiers Mappings section for more details. Refer to Database Administration section to choose and configure your databases.
