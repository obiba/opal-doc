R Server
========

Opal delegates many of its computation and data source connection capabilities to the attached R server(s).

See the `Rock R server documentation <https://rockdoc.obiba.org>`_ to install and configure one or more instances of R server that Opal will use to balance the computation load.

  Add more Rock servers and balance the load to scale R services horizontally.
