Introduction
============

Opal is `OBiBa <https://www.obiba.org>`_'s core database application for biobanks. Participant data, once collected either from OBiBa's Onyx application, must be integrated and stored in a central data repository under a uniform model. Opal is such a central repository. Current Opal version can import, process, and copy data. Opal is typically used in a research center to analyze the data acquired at assessment centres. Its ultimate purpose is to achieve seamless data-sharing among biobanks.
